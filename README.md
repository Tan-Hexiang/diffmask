# DiffMask

## Overview
This library contains a Pytorch implementation of Differentiable Masking Explainer (Diffmask), as presented in [[1]](#citation)(https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14992).

## Dependencies

* **python>=3.6**
* **pytorch>=1.5**: https://pytorch.org
* **pytorch-lightning==0.7.3**: https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io
* **transformers>=2.9.0**: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
* **torch-optimizer>=0.0.1a9**: https://github.com/jettify/pytorch-optimizer
* **matplotlib>=3.1.1**: https://matplotlib.org

*Notice that older or newer version could work but they were not tested.*

## Installation

To install, run

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```

To donwload datasets run
```bash
$ ./scripts/download_datasets.sh
```

To download models, use the following [link](https://mega.nz/folder/19QwELDK#CxKo4UO2P8KDt5TwYWfhmA). **Note that these are not the exaclt same models used for the paper.**


## Structure
* [diffmask](https://github.com/nicola-decao/diffmask/tree/master/diffmask): Contains the source code for DiffMask.

We have 5 jupyter notebbok with the code for reproducing some of the results from our work [[1](#citation)]. **Note that since i) the code was refactored and ii) we were not able to realise the exact same models used for the paper, re-generated plots and tables might differ from the ones in our work.**

* [QuestionAnsweringSquadAnalysis](https://github.com/nicola-decao/diffmask/tree/master/QuestionAnsweringSquadAnalysis.ipynb) Plots and analysis using other methods of a BERT large model for question answering.
* [QuestionAnsweringSquadDiffMaskAnalysis](https://github.com/nicola-decao/diffmask/tree/master/QuestionAnsweringSquadDiffMaskAnalysis.ipynb) Plots and analysis using **DiffMask** of a BERT large model for question answering.
* [SentimentClassificationSSTAnalysis](https://github.com/nicola-decao/diffmask/tree/master/SentimentClassificationSSTAnalysis.ipynb) Plots and analysis using other methods of a BERT base model for sentiment analisys.
* [SentimentClassificationSSTDiffMaskAnalysis](https://github.com/nicola-decao/diffmask/tree/master/SentimentClassificationSSTDiffMaskAnalysis.ipynb) Plots and analysis using **DiffMask** of a BERT base model for sentiment analisys.
* [ToyTask](https://github.com/nicola-decao/diffmask/tree/master/ToyTask.ipynb) Training, analysis and plots for the artificial toy task using both other methods and **DiffMask**.
